# Weavr Resolutions Web Interface

## Contribution Guidelines

Open a new branch off of `main` with naming scheme:

`<your-name>/<feature>`

General rules:
- Branches should aim to be as small in scope as possible and merge back into `main` in a timely fashion.
- Open a draft pull request as soon as possible detailing the changes made in your branch and open it for review when complete.
- Try to coordinate with other contributors via Discord as much as possible to avoid crossover and potential merge conflicts.
- Push your code so we know what you're doing! (even if its not done or working yet).
